\section{Introduction}

In the realm of contemporary data processing, the emergence of Apache Spark
stands as a transformative force. Developed within UC Berkeley's AMPLab in 2009
and guided by Matei Zaharia's vision, Spark redefines how data is harnessed for
analysis and insights. With its foundation in in-memory computing, Spark
challenges traditional paradigms, delivering unparalleled speed and versatility.
This introduction sets the stage to explore Spark's components, strengths,
limitations, and historical context, uncovering its pivotal role in the
evolution of data processing.
